# FvU
Fused versus Unfused - Modelling the behaviour of chromosomal clines

Veltsos et al. 2008 modelled two things. (1) the selection conditions for which a neo-X/neo-Y sex determination system can become fixed in a population with X0-system, and (2) which conditons favour the spread of the neo-sex chromosome system into other populations. This repo recapitulates and extends (2).

**FvsU.R** recapitulates what was done in Veltsos et al. 2008 to model the spread of a sex determination system among populations (along a gradient).

**FvU3D.R**
extends **FvsU.R** from looking at a gradient to include an area.
